-- Deleting a quiz archives it.

-- A quiz that has been hosted cannot be deleted outright — every game played from
-- it points back at it — and should not be: the reports in a later phase need the
-- words of the questions a class was actually asked, not just their positions.
-- So "Delete" hides it from the teacher and makes it unhostable, and the row stays.
